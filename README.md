# Trusted Signing Notation Plugin

This Notation plugin allows you to use Microsoft's **Trusted Signing** service to sign and verify container images and other OCI artifacts. Signatures enable users to verify that these artifacts are from a trusted source and have not been tampered with since their release.

Please refer to [MS Learn Trusted Signing Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/) for more information on the service.
